Handwriting refers to the style and appearance of writing made by hand, reflecting the unique characteristics of an individualâ€™s motor skills and personal style. It can vary greatly depending on factors like technique, speed, and purpose. Some common aspects that define handwriting include:

Size: Handwriting can range from large to small, with some individuals writing with wide strokes, while others write with compact, narrow letters.

Shape: The form of the letters can be round, angular, or a mix of both. Some people have a more cursive or flowing style, while others may write in block letters with more distinct separation between characters.

Slant: Handwriting can be slanted to the left, right, or can remain upright. This slant is often an expression of the writer's personality, and can even indicate emotional states.

Spacing: Some individuals write with tight, closely spaced letters, while others may leave more space between characters or words. This can make handwriting appear more condensed or spread out.
